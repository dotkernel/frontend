## Tools

DotKernel can be installed through a single command that utilizes [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). Because of that, Composer is required to install DotKernel `frontend`.

### Composer

Installation instructions:

- [Composer Installation -  Linux/Unix/OSX](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx)
- [Composer Installation - Windows](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-windows)

> If you have never used composer before make sure you read the [`Composer Basic Usage`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md) section in Composer's documentation

## Choosing an installation path for DotKernel `frontend` 

Example:

- absolute path `/var/www/dk`
- or relative path `dk` (equivalent with `./dk`)

## Installing DotKernel `frontend`

After choosing the path for DotKernel (`dk` will be used for the remainder of this example) it must be installed. There are two installation methods.

#### Note
The installation uses the PHP extension `ext-intl` that may not be enabled by default in your web server. If the installation returns a similar error to the below, check the `extension=intl` extension in your `php.ini`.

```bash
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

Problem 1
 - laminas/laminas-i18n 2.10.3 requires ext-intl * -> the requested PHP extension intl is missing from your system.
```

To enable an extension, remove the semicolon (;) in front of it.

#### I. Installing DotKernel `frontend` using composer 

The advantage of using this command is that it runs through the whole installation process. Run the following command:

```bash
$ composer create-project dotkernel/frontend -s dev dk
```

The above command downloads the `frontend` package, then downloads and installs the `dependencies`.

The setup script prompts for some configuration settings, for example the lines below:

```shell
Please select which config file you wish to inject 'Laminas\Diactoros\ConfigProvider' into:
  [0] Do not inject
  [1] config/config.php
  Make your selection (default is 0):
```

Simply select `[0] Do not inject`, because DotKernel includes its own configProvider which already contains the prompted configurations.
If you choose `[1] config/config.php` Laminas's `ConfigProvider` from `session` will be injected.

The next question is:

`Remember this option for other packages of the same type? (y/N)`

Type `y` here, and hit `enter`

#### II. Installing DotKernel `frontend` using git clone

This method requires more manual input, but it ensures that the default branch is installed, even if it is not released. Run the following command:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/dotkernel/frontend.git .
```

The dependencies have to be installed separately, by running this command
```bash
$ composer install
```

Just like for `II Installing DotKernel frontend using composer` (see above), the setup asks for configuration settings regarding injections (type `0` and hit `enter`) and a confirmation to use this setting for other packages (type `y` and hit `enter`)

## Configuration - First Run

- Remove the `.dist` extension from the files `config/autoload/local.php.dist` and `config/autoload/mail.local.php.dist`
- Edit `config/autoload/local.php` according to your dev machine and fill in the `database` configuration

## Configuration - Mail
 
If you want your application to send mails on registration, contact... please provide valid credentials to the following keys in `config/autoload/mail.local.php`

Under `message_options` key:
- `from` - email address from whom users will receive emails (required)
- `from_name` - organization name from whom users will receive emails (optional)

Under `smtp_options` key:
- `host` - hostname or IP address of the mail server (required)
- `connection_config` - please complete the `username` and `password` keys (required)

In `config/autoload/local.php` add under `contact` => `message_receivers` => `to` key *string* values with the emails that should receive contact messages

Note: **Please add at least 1 email address in order for contact message to reach someone**

Also feel free to add as many cc as you want under `contact` => `message_receivers` => `cc` key

## Configuration - reCAPTCHA

reCAPTCHA is used to prevent abusive activities on your website. DotKernel frontend uses the Google reCAPTCHA for its contact us form.
You must first generate a `siteKey` and `secretKey` in your Google account - [Google reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin)

Update the `recaptcha` array in `config/autoload/local.php` with the `siteKey` and `secretKey` from Google reCAPTCHA.

Note: you need to whitelist `localhost` in the reCAPTCHA settings page during development.
**When in production do not forget to either remove `localhost` from the reCAPTCHA whitelist, or have a separate reCAPTCHA**


## Migrations

Run the migrations and seeds with these commands:

```bash
php vendor/bin/phinx migrate --configuration="config/migrations.php"
php vendor/bin/phinx seed:run --configuration="config/migrations.php"
```

### Migration alternative with Doctrine
Out of the box, we use Phinx like detailed above to populate the database. Doctrine is an alternative that is also ready to use for new migrations. An example file is included in `/data/doctrine/migrations`, but it's empty, so it won't run any queries. It can be edited freely. To generate a new migration file, use this command 

```bash
php vendor/bin/doctrine-migrations migrations:generate
```
It creates a PHP file like this one `/data/doctrine/migrations/Version20220606131835.php` that can then be edited in the IDE. You can add new queries to be executed when the migration is run (in `public function up`) and optionally queries that undo those changes (in `public function down`).

Here is an example you can add in `public function up` 
```bash
$this->addSql('ALTER TABLE users ADD test VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL');
```
and its opposite in `public function down`
```bash
$this->addSql('ALTER TABLE users DROP test');
```

Running the migrations is done with this command
```bash
php vendor/bin/doctrine-migrations migrate
```
Note: if you have already run the phinx migrations, you may get this message
```bash
WARNING! You have x previously executed migrations in the database that are not registered migrations.
  {migration list}
Are you sure you wish to continue? (y/n)
```
After submitting `y`, you will get this confirmation message.
```bash
WARNING! You are about to execute a database migration that could result in schema changes and data loss. Are you sure you wish to continue? (y/n)
```
Again, submit `y` to run all the migrations in chronological order. Each migration will be logged in the `migrations` table to prevent running the same migration more than once, which is often not desirable.

You can opt to run a single migration
```bash
php vendor/bin/doctrine-migrations migrations:execute --up 'DotKernel4\Frontend\Migrations\Version20220606131835'
```
and you can revert its changes with
```bash
php vendor/bin/doctrine-migrations migrations:execute --down 'DotKernel4\Frontend\Migrations\Version20220606131835'
```
This will also remove the log for that migration in the database, allowing the migration to run again with `php vendor/bin/doctrine-migrations migrate`. 
Note the `DotKernel4\Frontend\Migrations` is the migration namespace taken from the configuration file, `migrations.php`

## Development mode

- If you use `composer create-project`, the project will go into development mode automatically after installing. The development mode status can be checked and toggled by using these composer commands

```bash
$ composer development-status
$ composer development-enable
$ composer development-disable
```

- If not already done on installation, remove the `.dist` extension from `config/autoload/development.global.php.dist`.
This will enable dev mode by turning debug flag to `true` and turning configuration caching to `off`. It will also make sure that any existing config cache is cleared.

> Charset recommendation: utf8mb4_general_ci

## Email Templates

These are the email templates provided on a fresh installation, all present in the User module

- `activate.html.twig` used for the activation email
- `reset-password-requested.html.twig` used when the user requests a password reset
- `reset-password-completed.html.twig` used when the password has reset successfully

## NPM Commands

To install dependencies into the `node_modules` directory run this command.
```bash
npm install
``` 
- If `npm install` fails, this could be caused by user permissions of npm. Recommendation is to install npm through `Node Version Manager`.

The watch command compiles the components then watches the files and recompiles when one of them changes.

```bash
npm run watch
```  

After all updates are done, this command compiles the assets locally, minifies them and makes them ready for production. 

```bash
npm run prod
```
## Authorization Guards
The packages responsible for restricting access to certain parts of the application are [dot-rbac-guard](https://github.com/dotkernel/dot-rbac-guard) and [dot-rbac](https://github.com/dotkernel/dot-rbac). These packages work together to create an infrastructure that is customizable and diversified to manage user access to the platform by specifying the type of role the user has.

The `authorization.global.php` file provides multiple configurations specifying multiple roles as well as the types of permissions to which these roles have access.

```php
//example of a flat RBAC model that specifies two types of roles as well as their permission
    'roles' => [
                'admin' => [
                    'permissions' => [
                        'authenticated',
                        'edit',
                        'delete',
                        //etc..
                    ]
                ],
                'user' => [
                    'permissions' => [
                        'authenticated',
                        //etc..
                    ]
                ]
            ]
```

The `authorization-guards.global.php` file provides configuration to restrict access to certain actions based on the permissions defined in `authorization.global.php` so basically we have to add the permissions in the dot-rbac configuration file first to specify the action restriction permissions.

```php
// configuration example to restrict certain actions of some routes based on the permissions specified in the dot-rbac configuration file
    'rules' => [
                    [
                        'route' => 'account',
                        'actions' => [//list of actions to apply , or empty array for all actions
                            'unregister',
                            'avatar',
                            'details',
                            'changePassword'
                        ],
                        'permissions' => ['authenticated']
                    ],
                    [
                        'route' => 'admin',
                        'actions' => [
                            'deleteAccount'
                        ],
                         'permissions' => [
                            'delete'
                            //list of roles to allow
                        ]
                    ]
                ]
```

## Slug 

In terms of business logic, any application launched in production needs to be indexed by search engines as friendly as possible.

Here comes the *Slug module* that works together with the application's routing system, which adds the option to customize each route replacing the old pattern such as the name of the route as well as its action with a chosen alias. On top of that, it allows you to replace the attributes with a more coherent version without losing their main functionality.

The `slug.global.php.dist` is the main configuration for *Slug module* .

```php
 // How to add a registered route to your slug configuration.
 'slug_configuration' => [
        // Detect a duplicate alias to avoid confusion.
        // We may have duplicate aliases but it is not recommended
        // that it requires future development on each project.
        'detect_duplicates' => true,
        // Main slug declaration.
        'slug_route' => [
            [
                'route'     => '[route name]',    // <- Specify the route name.
                'action'    => '[route action]',  // <- Specify the route action.
                'alias'     => '/[alias]',        // <- Here you must add an alias for the
                // specific route ex: /list/detail -> /product-detail.
                'exchange'  => [                  // <- If you want to exchange your route
                // attribute specify the exchange configuration or leave it empty.
                    '[attribute name]' => [                              // <- Attribute name.
                          'table'           => '[table name]',           // <- The main table from which the attribute belongs. 
                          'identifier'      => '[table identifier]',     // <- This must be the main attribute afferent column.
                          'exchangeColumn'  => '[exchange column name]', // <- Specify the main column from which the slug will be generated.
                          'slugColumn'      => '[slug column]'           // <- This will be the main storage column for the generated slug.
                     ],
                     .
                     .
                     // You can add here more attribute.
                ]
            ],
            .
            .
            // You can add here more routes.
        ]
    ]
```
The main functionality of the `exchange` key is to replace one or more attributes that play the role of unique identifier later being used in controllers to access certain information, these unique identifiers can have an unfriendly format, irrelevant to the end user.

Therefore, we can replace the attribute with an auto-generated value from the column specified in the `exchangeColumn` key and then saved in the `slugColumn`.

Of course, we will have to make certain changes in the respective table requiring a field in which the generated value will be saved.

```php
 // Example of slug configuration.
 'slug_configuration' => [
        'detect_duplicates' => true,
        'slug_route' => [
            [
                'route'     => 'page',
                'action'    => 'home',
                'alias'     => '/home-page',
                'exchange'  => []
            ],
              // The slug configuration will replace the basic route pattern with a specified alias so
              // the route path will be changed from `/page/home` to `/home-page`.
            [
                'route'     => 'product',
                'action'    => 'detail',
                'alias'     => '/product',
                'exchange'  => [
                    'uuid' => [
                          'table'           => 'products',
                          'identifier'      => 'uuid',
                          'exchangeColumn'  => 'name',
                          'slugColumn'      => 'slug'
                     ],
                ]
            ],
              // The above configuration will replace the `uuid` attribute from 
              // the route declaration path `/product[/{action}[/{uuid}]]` with a generated value from
              // `exchangeColumn` and stored in `slugColumn` key without changing his main functionality
              // Therefore, changing the path with a more friendly format from
              // `/product/detail/2e4c49d2-8187-11eb-a1c1-0c4de9a75a56` to `/product/product-name`.
        ]
    ]
```

*Remember that you can add the slug configuration only to a valid registered route !*

For redirect response you must use `UrlHelperPlugin::class` to generate the url, this class can detect the slug configuration.

## Languages

The `local.php.dist` file provides an example for working with multiple languages. The `translator` variable can be expanded to other languages using [Poedit](https://poedit.net/) which can edit `.po` files like the example in `data/language/da_DK/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po`. The compiled file will have the extension `.mo`

To apply the translations 
- the twig templates need either `{% trans 'translateText' %}` or `{{ translateText|trans }}`
- then the js file needs `translateText("translateText")`


## Testing (Running)

Note: **Do not enable dev mode in production**

- Run the following command in your project's directory to start PHPs built-in server:

```bash
$ php -S 0.0.0.0:8080 -t public
```

> Running command `composer serve` will do the exact same, but the above is faster.

`0.0.0.0` means that the server is open to all incoming connections
`127.0.0.1` means that the server can only be accessed locally (localhost only)
`8080` the port on which the server is started (the listening port for the server)

**NOTE:**
If you are still getting exceptions or errors regarding some missing services, try running the following command

```php
php bin/clear-config-cache.php
```

> If `config-cache.php` is present that config will be loaded regardless of the `ConfigAggregator::ENABLE_CACHE` in `config/autoload/mezzio.global.php`

- Open a web browser and visit `http://localhost:8080/`

You should see the `DotKernel Frontend` welcome page.
